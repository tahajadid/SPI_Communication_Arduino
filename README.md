# SPI_Communication_Arduino

SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a serial communication protocol. SPI interface was found by Motorola in 1970. SPI has a full duplex connection, which means that the data is sent and received simultaneously. That is a master can send data to slave and a slave can send data to master simultaneously. SPI is synchronous serial communication means the clock is required for communication purpose.

# How it works

SPI has following four lines MISO, MOSI, SS, and CLK

__MISO (Master in Slave Out) - The Slave line for sending data to the master.__


__MOSI (Master Out Slave In) - The Master line for sending data to the peripherals.__


__SCK (Serial Clock) - The clock pulses which synchronize data transmission generated by the master.__


__SS (Slave Select) â€“Master can use this pin to enable and disable specific devices.__

# Using SPI in Arduino

1.We need to learn about the SPI library used in Arduino IDE.

__The library <SPI.h> is included in the program for using the following functions for SPI communication.__

*SPI.begin()*

To Initialize the SPI bus by setting SCK, MOSI, and SS to outputs, pulling SCK and MOSI low, and SS high.

*SPI.setClockDivider(divider)*

To Set the SPI clock divider relative to the system clock. The available dividers are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128.

*SPI.transfer(val)*

This function is used to simultaneous send and receive the data between master and slave.
