# SPI_Communication_Arduino

SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a serial communication protocol. SPI interface was found by Motorola in 1970. SPI has a full duplex connection, which means that the data is sent and received simultaneously. That is a master can send data to slave and a slave can send data to master simultaneously. SPI is synchronous serial communication means the clock is required for communication purpose.

# How it works

SPI has following four lines MISO, MOSI, SS, and CLK

__MISO (Master in Slave Out) - The Slave line for sending data to the master.__


__MOSI (Master Out Slave In) - The Master line for sending data to the peripherals.__


__SCK (Serial Clock) - The clock pulses which synchronize data transmission generated by the master.__


__SS (Slave Select) â€“Master can use this pin to enable and disable specific devices.__
